# TF2-ish Critical Hits

Love dealing critical hits in Final Fantasy XIV, but you feel there's some... **_oomph_** missing?

Worry no more! With the **TF2-ish Critical Hits** plugins you can (almost) reproduce the experience of dealing Critical
Hits and Mini Crits in the #1 hat simulator, Team Fortress 2!
